# Mechanical
Our mechanical CAD repository. To get started, please see follow the guide below:

## Setting Up with GitHub Desktop:

*Using github desktop is the simplest method

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Create an account or login.
3. Go to the [Thunderbot's mechanical repository](https://github.com/UBC-Thunderbots/Mechanical) on GitHub.
4. Click on the green ```<> Code``` button and click: ```Open with GitHub Desktop```
5. Click Choose... and navigate to a local directory where you want to clone the repository. *Note that this location will be where a local copy of the entire CAD file will be stored.
6. Click Clone.
7. Ask to be added as a collaborator to the repository.

By now, you should have a local copy of the entire mechanical CAD folder.


## Workflow: Updating your local folder:

Before you make any changes to the mechanical assembly, it is important that you update your local CAD folder with any changes that may have been made by someone else so you are working with the most up-to-date mechanical assembly.

1. **On GitHub Desktop** click ```fetch```. This will _fetch_ any changes that have been made to the remote repository to you computer, without actually updating your local folder yet.

After fetching, you should be notified whether there are any merge conflicts. In other words, whether there have been any changes made to files that you have also modified on your local folder.

If there is a merge conflict:
1. Give-up.


If there is no merge conflict:
1. Click on ```Pull Origin``` and your local folder should automatically be updated to reflect any changes on the remote repository.


## Workflow: Updating your changes to the remote repository:

If you have any new changes, they should show up in your **GitHub Desktop** application under "Changed Files" - otherwise, you did something wrong.
1. Start off with ```committing to main```. Name the change you made under Summary _(e.g. New Dribbler Design)_.
2. After it commits successfully, the button at the top should read ```Push Origin```
3. Click on it. Do make sure that **nobody else is/was working on the same file you did - communicate this clearly before moving forward.**
